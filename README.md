# üåç Translation Web App with Azure AI Interface & DeepSeek-V3 Model

## Project Overview
This project is an intelligent translation web application that leverages the **DeepSeek-V3 model** via the **Azure AI interface** to break language barriers. The app allows users to translate text in real-time across multiple languages with high accuracy and context-aware translations. Built using FastAPI and Azure AI services, it offers a seamless user experience.

## üîß Technical Implementation

- **AI Backbone**: Integrated the **DeepSeek-V3 model** through the **Azure AI interface** for high-quality translations. The model provides fast and accurate language translations powered by Azure‚Äôs robust infrastructure.
- **Backend**: The backend is built using **FastAPI** (Python), with **SQLAlchemy** and **SQLite** for storing translation history. This allows users to track their previous translations and build a translation memory.
- **Frontend**: A modern **JavaScript** frontend, utilizing **Axios** for seamless API communication. This ensures smooth interactions with the backend and user-friendly translation experiences.
- **Azure AI Interface**:
  - Utilized Azure's AI inference API to access the **DeepSeek-V3 model** for scalable and high-performance translations.
  - **Custom prompt engineering** to optimize translation results, fine-tuning AI responses for high accuracy.
  - Secure credential management for safe handling of sensitive data.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time Multi-language Translation**: Quickly translate text across multiple languages, powered by the DeepSeek-V3 model via Azure AI.
- **Translation Memory**: Store and access your previous translations for consistent language use.
- **Intelligent Prompt Engineering**: Use settings like **temperature=0.8** and **top_p=0.1** for optimal AI responses.
- **Context-aware Translations**: System message priming ensures that the translation is contextually relevant.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures smooth API communication and graceful failure management.

## üí° What I Learned

- **Integrating AI Services via Azure**: Gained hands-on experience using the **Azure AI interface** to integrate the **DeepSeek-V3 model** into a web application, handling complex API interactions, and ensuring scalability.
- **Optimizing Large Language Models**: Learned how to fine-tune model parameters for better performance and reduced inference costs.
- **Building Secure API Gateways**: Worked on securing API endpoints, including token-based authentication and best practices for API key management.
- **Managing AI Inference Costs**: Gained insights into cost optimization by adjusting model parameters and selecting appropriate Azure services for the task.
